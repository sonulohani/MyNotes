In CMake, `CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR` and `CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR` are variables that refer to different directories under certain circumstances:- **`CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR`** points to the directory where the currently processed `CMakeLists.txt` file is located. This remains consistent even if the `CMakeLists.txt` file includes other lists from different directories.- **`CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR`**, on the other hand, refers to the directory of the list file that is currently being processed. Its value changes as CMake processes different list files in your project. For example, if a `CMakeLists.txt` file includes another list file from a subdirectory, `CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR` will point to that subdirectory while the included list file is being processed. 

 

Here's a practical example to illustrate the difference:If you have a `CMakeLists.txt` in a directory called `project` and it contains the directive `include(src/CMakeLists.txt)`, then while `src/CMakeLists.txt` is being processed, `CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR` will refer to `project/src`, whereas `CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR` will still point to the outer directory `project`.`CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR` is particularly useful when you need to locate resources like template files or scripts that are located next to the `CMakeLists.txt` file currently being processed¹.Remember, when using the `add_subdirectory()` command instead of `include()`, the behavior is different, and both variables will point to the same directory, which is the subdirectory being added¹.
