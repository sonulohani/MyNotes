Certainly! Here's a basic `ripgrep` cheatsheet in Markdown format:

# Ripgrep (rg) Cheatsheet

## Basic Usage:

1. **Search for a pattern recursively in the current directory:**
   ```bash
   rg pattern
   ```

2. **Search for a pattern in a specific directory:**
   ```bash
   rg pattern /path/to/directory
   ```

3. **Search for a pattern in specific file types:**
   ```bash
   rg pattern --type <filetype>
   ```

4. **Search for a pattern excluding specific files/directories:**
   ```bash
   rg pattern --ignore-file <filename>
   ```

## Filtering and Options:

5. **Case-insensitive search:**
   ```bash
   rg -i pattern
   ```

6. **Whole word search:**
   ```bash
   rg -w pattern
   ```

7. **Search for a pattern only in file names:**
   ```bash
   rg -g <pattern>
   ```

8. **Search for multiple patterns:**
   ```bash
   rg 'pattern1|pattern2'
   ```

9. **Display line numbers in the output:**
   ```bash
   rg -n pattern
   ```

10. **Show only the matching part of the line:**
    ```bash
    rg -o pattern
    ```

## Output Control:

11. **Display the number of matches in each file:**
    ```bash
    rg -c pattern
    ```

12. **Display file names only (no matched lines):**
    ```bash
    rg -l pattern
    ```

13. **Display lines before and after the match:**
    ```bash
    rg -C 2 pattern
    ```

## Advanced Usage:

14. **Search for a pattern in specific file types with custom file matching:**
    ```bash
    rg -tpyml pattern
    ```

15. **Search with a custom regular expression:**
    ```bash
    rg -e 'pattern'
    ```

16. **Search for a pattern recursively but ignore hidden files:**
    ```bash
    rg --hidden -g 'pattern'
    ```

17. **Search for a pattern in compressed files (e.g., .gz):**
    ```bash
    rg --search-zip pattern
    ```

18. **Include/exclude hidden files:**
    ```bash
    rg --hidden
    rg --no-ignore
    ```

## Performance and Optimization:

19. **Limit search to specific file types for performance:**
    ```bash
    rg --type-list
    ```

20. **Parallel search using multiple threads:**
    ```bash
    rg --threads N pattern
    ```

These are just some common use cases for `ripgrep`. For more detailed information, you can refer to the official documentation (`man rg` or `rg --help`).
