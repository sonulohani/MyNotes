The dot product (also known as the scalar product or inner product) of two vectors a and b is a single value that represents the amount of "similarity" between the two vectors.

Mathematically, it's calculated as:

dot(a, b) = a.x * b.x + a.y * b.y + a.z * b.z

In other words, you multiply corresponding components (x, y, z) of each vector together and sum them up. This gives you a single scalar value that represents the "amount" of similarity between the two vectors.

Here are some common interpretations of the dot product:


    Positive result: The vectors point in roughly the same direction.

    Negative result: The vectors point in opposite directions.

    Zero result: The vectors are perpendicular (at right angles) to each other.


In various fields, such as physics, engineering, and computer graphics, the dot product is used extensively for tasks like:


    Calculating the magnitude (length) of a vector.

    Determining the angle between two vectors.

    Computing the projection of one vector onto another.

    Performing transformations and projections in 3D space.


In our original context, the dot product was used to calculate the diffuse lighting contribution based on the angle between the light direction vector and the surface normal vector.
